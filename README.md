Bash 

Config

Used on Debian for years, should work with other Debian-based distros or even others distros using bash (might need some tuning).
Use the function "install_bashrc_support"

Replace your current bash config (named ".bashrc") with this one (change the name from "bashrc" to ".bashrc"). (MAKE BACKUP FIRST)

Necessary links are given inside the config as comments. (Like for the "Starship" prompt)

KDE

Enjoy
